# ChemEAGLE


## :sparkles: Highlights
<p align="justify">
In this work, we present ChemEagle, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system that integrates diverse chemical information extraction tools to extract multimodal chemical reactions. By integrating 10 expert-designed tools and 6 chemical information extraction agents, ChemEagle not only processes individual modalities but also utilizes MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to unify extracted data, ensuring more accurate and comprehensive reaction representations. By bridging multimodal gaps, our approach significantly improves automated chemical knowledge extraction, facilitating more robust AI-driven chemical research.

## ü§ó Multimodal chemical information extraction using [ChemEagle.Web](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CYF200127/ChemEagle) 

Go to our [ChemEagle.Web demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CYF200127/ChemEagle) to directly use our tool online!

When the input is a multimodal chemical reaction graphics:

The input can be any chemical graphics, feel free to try more examples! (NOTE: If the local CPU is larger than 8 cores, it is recommended to use the local code, which will be faster than the web demo.)

## :rocket: Using the code and the model
### Using the code
Clone the following repositories:
```
git clone https://github.com/CYF2000127/ChemEagle
```
### Example usage of the model
1. First create and activate a [conda](https://numdifftools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-to/create_virtual_env_with_conda.html) environment with the following command in a Linux, Windows, or MacOS environment (Linux is the most recommended):
```
conda create -n chemeagle python=3.10
conda activate chemeagle
```

2. Then install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the necessary [model](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CYF200127/ChemEagle/blob/main/pix2seq_reaction_full.ckpt) and put in the main path.

4. Set up your API keys in your environment.
```
export API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
export AZURE_ENDPOINT=your-azure-endpoint-if-use
```

4. Run the following code to extract machine-readable chemical data from a chemical graphics:
```python
from main import ChemEagle
image_path = './examples/1.png'
results = ChemEagle(image_path)
print(results)
```

### Benchmarking
All benchmark datasets, predictions, and ground truth can be found in our [Huggingface Repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CYF200127/ChemEagle/blob/main/Dataset.zip).
