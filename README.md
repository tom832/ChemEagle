# ChemEAGLE
This is the official code of the paper "A Multi-Agent System Enables Versatile Information Extraction from the Chemical Literature"

## :sparkles: Highlights
<p align="justify">
In this work, we present ChemEAGLE, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system that integrates diverse chemical information extraction tools to extract multimodal chemical reactions. By integrating ten expert-designed tools and seven chemical information extraction agents, ChemEAGLE not only processes individual modalities but also utilizes MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to unify extracted data, ensuring more accurate and comprehensive reaction representations. By bridging multimodal gaps, our approach significantly improves automated chemical knowledge extraction, facilitating more robust AI-driven chemical research.

## :rocket: Using the code for ChemEAGLE
### Using the code
Clone the following repositories:
```
git clone https://github.com/CYF2000127/ChemEagle
```
### Example usage of the ChemEAGLE
1. First create and activate a [conda](https://numdifftools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-to/create_virtual_env_with_conda.html) environment with the following command in a Linux, Windows, or MacOS environment (Linux is the most recommended):
```
conda create -n chemeagle python=3.10
conda activate chemeagle
```

2. Then install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the necessary [models](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CYF200127/ChemEagle/tree/main) and put in the main path.

4. Set up your Azure OpenAI API key in your environment. Here is a detailed [tutorial](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/678367436) on how to obtain the Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint.
```
export API_KEY=your-azure-openai-api-key
export AZURE_ENDPOINT=your-azure-endpoint
export API_VERSION=your-api-version
```

4. Run the following code to extract machine-readable chemical data from a chemical graphics:
```python
from main import ChemEagle
image_path = './examples/1.png'
results = ChemEagle(image_path)
print(results)
```

### Benchmarking

The input can be any chemical graphics; feel free to try more examples! 
(NOTE: If the local CPU is larger than 8 cores, it is recommended to use the local code, which will be faster than the web demo. It will also be significantly faster using a GPU. The current version runs by default on the CPU for stability. The online version may not be as updated as the GitHub version.)
